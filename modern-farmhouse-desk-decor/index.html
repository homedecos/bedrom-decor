8 Farmhouse Kitchen Lighting Over Table farmhousedecor From farmhousedecor.co
Take a look at this farmhouse decor to get all the inspiration you need to seamlessly blend rustic, vintage, and modern styles. At first i wasn’t sure if my room was big enough to have a desk floating in the middle of the floor but once i got the desk in the space, it worked perfectly. Desks are great for getting work done, paying bills, checking your email on the computer, and more. Since my larger pieces of furniture are mid century modern style, i wanted to balance that with a modern farmhouse feel to the decor.
