You know I like the going to the ceiling From pinterest.com
When planning a new kitchen or major remodel, a key decision you�ll need to make is whether to run the upper wall cabinetry all the way to the ceiling or to install cabinets with a gap above them.most homes built in the last 50 years have kitchen cabinets that are 32 or 36 inches tall, installed so there is a gap of 1 to 2 feet between the tops of the cabinets and the ceiling. The white kitchen coupled with white curved ceiling makes the kitchen look big, bright, airy yet luxurious. That said, more and more kitchens do have cabinets that extend to the ceiling, even with 9 or 10 foot ceilings. Quality can be simplified by combining the right elements in kitchen design.
